          As an illustrative example, when working in sub-zero temperatures of

          of heated warming shelters, including tents, cabins, and restrooms.
          Employees are strongly advised to utilize these shelters judiciously,
          with usage contingent on the severity of exposure. In scenarios where
          the ambient temperature hovers around 12°C, additional precautions
          should be incorporated. These may include regular supervision,
          adopting a deliberate and measured work pace to prevent excessive
          sweating—which leads to damp clothing—and acclimating new employees

          In some provinces of Canada, the Occupational Health and Safety
          regulation addresses the challenges of working in extreme
          temperatures, particularly cold conditions and weather. The
          legislation ensures that all employers, employees, and other
          stakeholders are adhering to the legal requirements to have an
          understanding of the effects of extreme cold temperatures in the
          workplace and have knowledge of how to prevent and avoid accidents.
          Employers adhere to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial
          Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) when extreme
          temperature exposure is involved. These TLVs serve as occupational
          exposure limits or guidelines for each jurisdiction as shown in the
          table below where Sections 7.33 to 7.38 under British Columbia address
          the current ACGIH TLVs for cold exposure.

          WorkSafeBC in 2020 issued a cautionary reminder to employers and
          workers about the significance of taking safety measures while working
          in cold weather. Between 2015 and 2018, 30 workers in British Columbia
          suffered injuries due to cold exposure, with frostbite being the most
          common cold-related injury. Frostbite can rapidly develop in extreme
          temperatures, particularly in the presence of wind or wet clothing.
          Additionally, cold stress can lead to hypothermia, posing fatal risks
          if not addressed promptly. Barry Nakahara, Senior Manager of
          Prevention Field Services at WorkSafeBC, highlighted the severity of
          injuries that can occur when unprepared for working in cold
          conditions, stressing the critical role of proper clothing and
          equipment. Various industries such as transport, recreation,
          construction, and utility work involve significant outdoor exposure to
          cold weather, necessitating employers to conduct cold-stress
          assessments and implement protective plans for workers.
        </p>
        <h1>
          WorkSafeBC provides the following safety tips for working in cold
          weather:
        </h1>
        <li>Wear warm head covering.</li>
        <li>Layer clothing to allow sweat to escape and trap heat.</li>
        <li>
          Protect hands and feet. Wear waterproof boots and always wear gloves
          or mittens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pace any vigorous work with scheduled breaks away from the cold.
          Fatigue is a risk factor in the cold.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay hydrated. Limit the amount of coffee or tea and avoid alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>
          When possible, heat the working environment. For example, heated
          shelters help protect construction workers from cold and damp
          environments.
        </li>
        <h1 className="my-4 text-white font-bold text-center">
          WorkSafeBC also published a template questions to mitigate risks using

            </span>
            Eliminating the hazard by substituting a safer process or material,
            where possible, is the most effective control. Some questions to
            consider: Can the work be done in a different environment? Can a
            process that generates less cold or water be used?
          </li>

            </span>
            Making physical modifications to facilities, equipment and processes
            can reduce exposure. Some questions to consider: Can heated warming
            shelters be placed on site? Can machines and tools be designed so
            that they can be operated without having to remove mittens or
            gloves?

            </span>
            These involve changing work practices and work policies. Providing
            awareness tools and training also count as administrative controls.
            All can limit the risk of cold stress. Some questions to consider:
            Has an exposure control plan been developed? Can warning signs be
            posted in the work area? Can work rotation be used to decrease cold
            exposure? Can signs explaining exposure symptoms be posted? Can
            written safe work procedures be posted? Can work be paced
            differently so that workers don't have to exert themselves to the
            point of heavy sweating? Have workers received training and
            education to increase awareness of signs and symptoms of cold
            stress?

            This is the least effective control. When used, there must always be
            at least one other control in place as well. Some questions to
            consider: Can personal battery-operated heaters or chemical heating
            pads under clothing be used? Do workers have the proper protective
            clothing? (They need a warm head covering and layered clothing. They
            also need to keep hands and feet warm and dry.) Has personal
            protective equipment been tested to make sure it is working
            properly?

          Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety published that
          there are certain exposure limits that workplace should observe. They
          cited that American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
          (ACGIH) suggests a work-warming regimen when work is done continuously
          in the cold when the wind chill temperature is at or below-7°C
          (19.4°F), heated warming shelters (tents, cabins, rest rooms, etc)
          should be made available nearby. Workers should be encouraged to use
          these shelters, depending on the severity of the exposure. If signs of
          cold stress are noticed, return to the shelter immediately. For work
          at or below -12°C (10.4°F), work should include:
        </p>
        <li>constant observation (supervisor or buddy system),</li>
        <li>
          adjusting the pace or rate of work so that it is not too high and
          cause heavy sweating that will result in wet clothing
        </li>
        <li>time for new employees to become accustomed to the conditions</li>
        <li>
          adjusted to include the weight and bulkiness of the clothing when
          estimating work performance and weights to be lifted by the worker

          instructions in safe work practices, re-warming procedures, proper
          clothing practices, proper eating and drinking habits, recognition of
          cold stress/frostbite, and signs and symptoms of hypothermia or
          excessive cooling of the body (including when shivering does not
          occur)

          A research entitled “A model for managing cold-related health and
          safety risks at workplaces” by Risikko et. al (2003), highlighted the
          following framework:
        </h1>
        <li children="mb-4 list-none mb-4">
          <span className="text-orange"></span>
          Cold risk management should be fully integrated into the occupational health and safety (OHS) management system and practices of the company, in order to ensure the implementation and continuance of the activities. It shall thus follow the international and national OHS legislation and norms. 
        </li>
        <li children="mb-4 list-none mb-4">
          <span className="text-orange block">Standards. Risk assessment and management methods </span>
          ISO thermal standards provide guidelines of assessment and evaluation methods for thermal environments. Several of these standards can be used for assessing thermal risks caused by cold exposure. Most of the methods are self-contained, but they should be used in conjunction with each other in a comprehensive assessment

        </li>
        <li children="mb-4 ">
          <span className="text-orange block"> A systematic model for managing cold risks </span>
         The action model produced for assessing and managing the coldinduced health and safety risks at work is shown in figure 2. The activities must follow the norms given by general occupational safety laws, trade agreements and industry-specific safety regulations. In order to ensure the implementation and continuance of the activities, the cold risk management is integrated into the company’s OHS management system and general risk assessment and management practices

        </li>
        <li children="mb-4">
          <span className="text-orange block"> Cold Assessment</span>
         The method is based on observation and does not require comprehensive training, or knowledge in e.g. ergonomics. Furthermore, for a person at the workplace who is well aware of the contents of the work, conducting the observation does not require a long time, and is inexpensive for the company.

        </li>
        <li children="mb-4 block">
          <span className="text-orange block">Cold Risk Assessment</span>
According to the identified and assessed cold risks, various preventive measures against these hazards shall be planned and carried out at the workplace by the occupational safety delegates, supervisors and workers. All parties need to be informed about the actions to be made. The responsible person for each action are named. The activities shall be planned in written form, either as a part of the general occupational safety plan of an individual workplace, or as a separate cold risk management plan (figure 3). The purpose of the planning is to systematically take into account different aspects related to cold, as well as to guarantee the successful timing for implementing different preventive activities.

        <img src={coldrisk} alt='' />
        <li children="mb-8">
          <span className="text-orange block"> Planning and Organizing the Work</span>
         Organisational cold preventive measures are planned while planning and organising the work. Their main purposes are to control the duration and intensity of the cold exposure and to provide sufficient time, measures and spaces for recovery. For example, in outdoor work, extra manpower can be provided to reduce the cold exposure time. The work load should also be kept at a rather constant level to avoid excessive sweating and evaporative cooling after it.

        <p className="mt-4">As published by Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, cold affect work performance as it can lead to lower work efficiency and higher incident rates. Cold impairs the performance of complex mental tasks. Manual tasks are also impaired because the sensitivity and dexterity of fingers are reduced in the cold. At even lower temperatures, the cold affects the deeper muscles resulting in reduced muscular strength and stiffened joints. Mental alertness is reduced due to cold-related discomfort.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Colder temperatures may cause low energy, muscle strains, and falls. More in general, the effect of extreme temperatures on occupational health may operate through different channels, such as workers’ lower reaction capacities, cognitive performance, and concentration (Graff Zivin et al., 2018 as cited by Filomena & Picchio, 2023); compromised decision-making abilities (Heyes and Saberian, 2019 as cited by Filomena & Picchio, 2023); higher physical and mental stress (Heal and Park, 8 2016 as cited by Filomena & Picchio, 2023); perceived fatigue and energy outlays (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011 as cited by Filomena & Picchio, 2023); increased costs of safety investments for both workers and firms (Park et al., 2021 as cited by Filomena & Picchio, 2023).</p>

          encouraged, if not obligated, to educate workers on safe practices,
          physical fitness requirements, and emergency procedures. The absence
          of specific training requirements in the law does not diminish the
          importance of education in preventing accidents and ensuring a safe
          working environment in cold conditions.

          <span className="ml-12">In</span> conclusion, the provided information
          emphasizes a holistic approach to worker safety in cold conditions,
          encompassing legal compliance, risk mitigation through interventions,
          and the empowerment of workers through training and awareness
          programs. Employers in Vancouver are positioned to foster a culture of
          safety that goes beyond mere compliance, actively promoting the
          well-being of their workforce in challenging environmental conditions.

              Potential conflicts may arise from differences in communication
              styles, work habits, or task understanding. Competing priorities
              and conflicting deadlines could also pose challenges. To address
              these issues, the team utilizes WhatsApp for open communication
              and regular updates via shared Excel sheets to minimize
              misunderstandings. In case of conflicts, members engage in
              constructive dialogue, actively listening to each other's
              perspectives. Emphasizing collaboration, the team prioritizes
              compromise and consensus-building for efficient conflict
              resolution, fostering a positive team environment.
